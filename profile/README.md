## About Us
The Marine Ecology and Conservation (MEC) Laboratory operates as a research and academic unit based at the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute (UP MSI). The Laboratory undertakes research in marine ecology and conservation and supports academic mentoring, project implementation, and institutional collaboration.  
  
The laboratory functions under administrative systems:  
* The **University of the Philippines (UP)**, through UP Diliman, the College of Science, and the Marine Science Institute; and
* The **Marine Environment and Resources Foundation (MERF)**, which administers selected projects and funds.
  
The **main research goal** of MEC is to understand ecological patterns and processes, and their implications for conservation and management. MEC activities include:  
* Research activities in marine ecology and conservation
* Academic mentoring of MSc and PhD students in Marine Science
* Administrative and project management procedures
